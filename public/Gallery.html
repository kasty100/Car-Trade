			<p>I had been driving the Hyundai i10 for some time before I decided to buy a new car. I thankfully made the decision to buy the Hyundai Elite i20 1.4 CRDI Asta, one of the best cars in the hatchback segment so far. It is such a good looking and yet powerful car. It is an expensive car when you compare it with its competitors but then again the car has followers like me who agree to pay the higher price.</p>

			<p>Its a Volvo Masterpiece the Co. which never compromises with safety now comes with top notch features which will leave you spellbound just go to the nearest Volvo dealership to just have Peek-a-boo Feature Rich Car with a value for money Tag I am sure if you are planning to buy a car in this budget your first & last option will be this only.</p>

			<p>Nice car for a family, comfortable, good space, mileage is also good for a big car. In short, it is a good car with all features at a low cost as compared to other cars in the market. And from the most reliable company of India who knows Indian conditions better than anyone in the market. 4 captain seats make the difference in long-distance travel.</p>

			<p>I found BMW X5 as the best SUV among its competitors comes with a panoramic sunroof, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, alloy wheels, etc. Its powerful 2998cc engine performs amazingly and makes my drive comfortable and enjoyable. The ground clearance of X5 is really good that it can go on bad roads without any damage.</p>

			<p>The all-new Creta is a brilliant car, the performance of the car is great, features provided in the car are best in the segment and I highly recommended this car to all the people.</p>
